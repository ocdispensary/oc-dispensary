<h1>OC Dispensary Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: May 13, 2025</em></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to OC Dispensary’s Privacy Policy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what information OC Dispensary (<strong>“OC Dispensary,” “we,” “us,”</strong> or <strong>“our”</strong>) collects through our mobile application and website (collectively, the <strong>“Services”</strong>), how we use and share that information, and the choices you have. We comply with all applicable privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (<strong>HIPAA</strong>) for any protected health information we handle. Our Services are intended for adults <strong>21 years of age or older</strong>; we do not knowingly provide services to or collect information from anyone under 21 (see the “Children’s Privacy” section below). By using our app or website, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you are a medical cannabis patient, please also refer to our Notice of Privacy Practices for more details on how we protect your Protected Health Information (PHI) in compliance with HIPAA.</p>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect various types of information from and about you when you use our Services. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Information You Provide Directly:</strong> When you create an account, make a purchase, or use our Services, you may give us personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, date of birth, and mailing address. We may also collect <em>age-verification details</em> like a scanned government-issued ID or driver’s license to confirm you are of legal age. If you sign up for newsletters or alerts, we collect your email or phone number for that purpose. If you contact us (for example, through customer support or chat), we will collect the information you share during the correspondence.</li>
  <li><strong>Medical and Health Information:</strong> If you are a medical cannabis patient, we may collect health-related information such as your patient identification number, medical cannabis recommendation or certification details, prescribing physician’s name, and any health conditions or treatment information you provide. This health information is considered <strong>Protected Health Information (PHI)</strong> under HIPAA, and we handle it with additional care as required by law.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction and Order Information:</strong> We maintain records of the products you purchase or reserve through our app or website, any preference information (such as favorite products or strains), order dates and times, and related transaction details. For example, if you place an order, we record the items, quantities, and total price. If you use delivery services (where available), we may collect the delivery address and contact instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> If you make purchases through our Services, you may provide payment details. We use secure third-party payment processors to handle payment transactions, so we generally do not store your full credit/debit card numbers. However, we may keep records of payment method type (e.g., credit card, mobile pay), billing contact details, and transaction confirmations. All payment transactions are encrypted and processed in compliance with applicable security standards.</li>
  <li><strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong> When you use our website or app, we automatically collect some information about your device and how you interact with our Services. This may include your IP address, browser type, device type (e.g., iPhone or Android phone, computer), unique device identifiers, operating system version, and device language settings. We also collect data about your usage of the Services, such as the pages or screens you view, the features you use, the time and duration of visits, search queries, and referring website or app. If you enable location services for the mobile app, we may collect your precise geolocation data to show nearby store locations or verify eligibility for delivery services. You can control location sharing via your device settings.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies and Similar Technologies:</strong> We use cookies, pixels, and similar tracking technologies on our website to collect information about your browsing activities (see “Cookies and Tracking Technologies” below for details). These technologies help us remember your preferences, understand usage patterns, and personalize content.</li>
  <li><strong>Information from Third Parties:</strong> In some cases, we may receive information about you from third-party sources. For example, if state law requires us to verify your status as a medical patient in a state registry or check an ID verification service, we will obtain confirmation from those external systems. We might also receive referral information if you were referred to OC Dispensary by an affiliate or partner, or gather marketing lead information from partners if you consented to share your info with them. If you link or login to our Services through a third-party account (such as using “Sign in with Google” or a similar feature), we may receive certain profile information from that third party with your permission.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>OC Dispensary uses the information we collect for various purposes to operate our business, provide you with our Services, and improve your experience. These purposes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Providing and Improving Services:</strong> We use your information to process transactions and orders (e.g., to fulfill your purchases, arrange for pickup or delivery, and provide receipts), to manage your account (such as creating your user profile and login), and to deliver customer support. Your information helps us ensure you receive the correct products and an excellent customer experience. We also analyze usage information to understand how our Services are used and to make improvements or add new features that enhance your experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Verifying Identity and Eligibility:</strong> We use personal information such as your date of birth or ID verification to confirm that you are at least 21 years old (or a qualifying medical patient, where applicable) and legally permitted to use our app and website. This step is essential to comply with cannabis regulations that restrict access to adults of legal age. We may also use your information to verify any medical eligibility requirements if you are purchasing medical cannabis (for example, confirming your patient status in a state’s medical marijuana program).</li>
  <li><strong>Personalization and Recommendations:</strong> Information like your past purchases or preferences may be used to personalize the content you see on our Services. For instance, we might suggest products you may be interested in, show you relevant promotions, or tailor the ordering experience to your location and past buying habits. Personalization helps make your experience more useful and relevant.</li>
  <li><strong>Communicating with You:</strong> We use contact information (email, phone number) to communicate with you about your orders and our services. This includes sending order confirmations, purchase receipts, delivery or pickup updates, and responding to your inquiries. If you subscribe to marketing communications, we will also use your contact details to send you newsletters, special offers, event announcements, or other promotional messages about OC Dispensary products and deals. You can opt out of marketing emails or texts at any time (see “Your Rights and Choices” below), and we will only send you promotional communications in accordance with your preferences and applicable law.</li>
  <li><strong>Analytics and Service Improvement:</strong> We want to ensure our website and app are user-friendly and functioning properly. We use data (including cookies and similar tech) to analyze how users navigate and use our Services. This helps us troubleshoot issues, test new features, and understand what parts of our Services are most useful. For example, we might use Google Analytics or similar tools to see aggregated statistics on which pages are visited or how often the app is opened. These insights guide us in improving site/app performance, layout, and content.</li>
  <li><strong>Advertising and Marketing:</strong> We may use information about you to assist in our advertising efforts. For example, we might use cookies or mobile identifiers to participate in <em>interest-based advertising</em> programs, which means we (or our advertising partners) may tailor ads for OC Dispensary that you see on third-party websites or apps based on your interactions with our Services. If we run advertising campaigns, we may use your data to measure how effective our ads are (for instance, by seeing whether you visited our site after seeing an ad). Any such advertising use will follow applicable laws and industry guidelines. You have choices regarding targeted advertising – see “Cookies and Tracking Technologies” and “Your Rights and Choices” for more information on opting out.</li>
  <li><strong>Compliance and Legal Obligations:</strong> We may use your information as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations. OC Dispensary operates in a heavily regulated industry, and we are required to maintain certain records (for example, purchase and inventory records for state compliance and auditing). We will use and retain whatever data is needed to satisfy our legal and regulatory obligations under cannabis laws, tax laws, and other mandates. Additionally, if you are a medical patient, we may use your information as allowed by HIPAA and other health regulations for purposes such as treatment, payment, or health care operations (e.g., coordinating with your healthcare provider or maintaining required medical dispensing records). We also may use information to respond to valid legal requests or orders (such as subpoenas or government requests) and to enforce our Terms of Service or protect our rights and the safety of our users and staff.</li>
  <li><strong>Security and Fraud Prevention:</strong> Your information is also used to protect our Services and users. We monitor activities to detect and prevent fraud, unauthorized access, hacking, or other misuse. For example, we might use certain data to verify that a login is legitimate or to flag suspicious transaction patterns. This helps us keep our platform safe and secure.</li>
  <li><strong>Other Purposes with Your Consent:</strong> If we intend to use your information for any purpose not covered by this Privacy Policy, we will explain the purpose to you at the time of obtaining your information and, if required, ask for your consent. For instance, if we ever want to collect personal information for a new feature or share your information with a new partner, we would give you the choice to agree or decline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h2>
<p>We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience on our website, to understand usage patterns, and for analytics and advertising purposes. Here’s an overview of how we use these technologies and your choices:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong> Cookies are small text files that websites place on your device’s browser. They store data that can be retrieved by the website later – for example, to remember your login session or preferences. Cookies can be “session” cookies (which expire when you close your browser) or “persistent” cookies (which remain on your device for a set period or until you delete them). In addition to cookies, we and our partners may use other tracking technologies like web beacons (tiny graphic images embedded on pages or emails) or SDKs and mobile device identifiers in our app, which function similarly to cookies.</li>
  <li><strong>How We Use Cookies and Tracking Tech:</strong> OC Dispensary and our third-party service providers (like analytics and advertising partners) use these technologies for several reasons:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Essential Functions:</em> Some cookies are necessary for our site to work properly. For example, they enable core functionalities like your shopping cart, secure login, or remembering your age verification so you don’t have to verify on every page.</li>
      <li><em>Preferences:</em> We use cookies to remember your settings and preferences, such as language selection or remembering items you’ve added to a wishlist, to provide a more personalized experience.</li>
      <li><em>Analytics:</em> We use cookies and similar tools to collect information about how visitors use our website (pages visited, time spent, links clicked, etc.). For instance, we use Google Analytics on our website. Google Analytics sets cookies to gather usage data and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. This helps us understand which content is popular or where users might encounter issues, so we can improve navigation and design. (For more details on how Google Analytics works, you can visit Google’s Privacy Policy. You can also opt out of Google Analytics as described in the “Your Rights and Choices” section.)</li>
      <li><em>Advertising:</em> We may allow certain advertising or retargeting cookies/pixels on our site that enable us or our advertising partners to show you ads for OC Dispensary on other websites and measure their effectiveness. For example, if we participate in Google Ads or Facebook Ads, those platforms might set a cookie or pixel to note that you visited our site, which can later result in you seeing an OC Dispensary advertisement on their networks. These technologies may collect information such as your IP address, browser or device identifiers, and browsing behavior on our site to help tailor the ads you see on third-party sites. We do not allow third-party advertisers to collect your contact information (like email or name) via cookies on our site, but they may collect unique identifiers and device information as described.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Your Choices for Cookies:</strong> You have the ability to control or limit the use of cookies and similar technologies:
    <ul>
      <li>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies or alert you when a cookie is being placed. Please note that if you disable cookies entirely, some features of our site (such as staying logged in or remembering your cart) may not function properly.</li>
      <li>To learn about and opt out of Google Analytics on our website, you can use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-on</a> provided by Google. This tool prevents Google Analytics from collecting information on your visits.</li>
      <li>For our mobile app, you can reset or limit ad tracking via your device settings (for example, on iOS you can find an option to “Limit Ad Tracking,” and on Android you can “Opt out of Ads Personalization”). These settings control the use of your mobile device’s advertising ID by companies for interest-based advertising.</li>
      <li>Interest-Based Advertising Opt-Out: The third-party advertising partners we work with may be members of industry organizations that offer consumers the ability to opt out of targeted ads. You can visit the <a href="https://optout.networkadvertising.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Network Advertising Initiative’s opt-out page</a> or the <a href="https://www.aboutads.info/choices" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Choice page</a> to opt out of receiving targeted advertising from participating companies. Keep in mind this will opt you out of targeted ads from participating networks but you may still receive non-personalized ads or ads from companies not listed.</li>
      <li><em>Do Not Track:</em> “Do Not Track” (DNT) is a setting available in some web browsers that requests a website not to track your online activities. Currently, there is no universal standard for how websites should respond to DNT signals. At this time, our website does not respond differently to DNT signals. We continue to monitor developments around DNT and may update our practices if a uniform standard is established.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about our use of cookies and tracking technologies, or to change your preferences, you can contact us using the information in the Contact section of this Policy.</p>

<h2>5. Sharing and Disclosure of Information</h2>
<p>We understand that your personal information is important, and we are not in the business of selling your data. We only share or disclose your information in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Service Providers and Partners:</strong> We share your information with trusted third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, only to the extent necessary for those services. This includes, for example, companies that provide payment processing, age and ID verification services, delivery and logistics partners, email and text message distributors, customer support software providers, cloud hosting providers, and analytics service providers. These third parties are contractually required to safeguard your information and use it only for the purposes we specify. If any service provider handles PHI on our behalf (for example, a secure patient data management system or a cloud service storing medical information), we will have a Business Associate Agreement in place with them as required by HIPAA, obligating them to protect your health information.</li>
  <li><strong>Within Our Company and Affiliates:</strong> Information may be shared within the OC Dispensary organization (for example, between the mobile app team and the retail store team) and with any affiliate companies or entities under common ownership, for the purposes described in this policy. For instance, if OC Dispensary operates in multiple locations or has related brands, your information might be shared across these to streamline your experience and business operations. All such sharing is still bound by this Privacy Policy’s terms. If we ever establish parent companies, subsidiaries, or affiliates, we will ensure they also protect your information to at least the same standard.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Compliance and Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is required to comply with a legal obligation or request. This can include responding to subpoenas, warrants, or court orders, or cooperating with law enforcement or regulatory authorities (for example, providing purchase records to a state cannabis regulatory agency if lawfully requested). We may also disclose information to enforce our Terms of Service or other agreements, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of OC Dispensary, our customers, our employees, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.</li>
  <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If OC Dispensary is involved in a merger, acquisition, financing, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our business/assets, your information may be transferred to a successor or affiliate as part of that transaction. Should such a transfer occur, we will ensure that your information remains protected by appropriate privacy safeguards, and we will provide notice on our website (and/or notify you via email or other means) if your personal information becomes subject to a different privacy policy or terms.</li>
  <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> Apart from the situations listed above, we will request your explicit consent before sharing your personal information with third parties in ways not covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, if we ever want to publicly post a customer testimonial or share your details with a partner for their own marketing, we would ask for your permission first. You are in control – if you don’t agree, we will not share the information.</li>
  <li><strong>De-Identified or Aggregated Data:</strong> We may share information that has been de-identified (stripped of personal identifiers so you cannot reasonably be identified) or aggregated (combined with information about many other users). For instance, we might share general statistics about how many users shop for a certain product category or the average age of our customers. This information does not identify you personally and is used for industry analysis, marketing, and advertising, or other business purposes.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Special Note on Protected Health Information (PHI):</strong> If you are a medical cannabis patient, any sharing or disclosure of your PHI will be done in accordance with HIPAA and applicable state health privacy laws. This means we will use and disclose your health information only for purposes permitted by law (such as your treatment, processing your payment, or health care operations like internal management), or as otherwise authorized by you. We will NOT disclose your PHI to third parties for their marketing or other uses without your written authorization, except in very limited situations allowed by HIPAA (for example, in a medical emergency or if required by law). Your privacy rights regarding PHI are described in the “Your Rights and Choices” section and our Notice of Privacy Practices. We take additional precautions before sharing any PHI and will always strive to disclose only the minimum necessary information for the task at hand.</p>

<h2>6. Data Security Measures</h2>
<p>OC Dispensary takes the security of your personal information seriously. We implement a variety of security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. These measures include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We use encryption technology to protect sensitive data. For example, our website is secured via SSL/TLS (you’ll see an “https” in the URL), which encrypts information transmitted between your browser and our servers. If you use our mobile app, data transmitted is also encrypted. For any stored sensitive data (such as passwords or health records), we employ encryption and hashing techniques where appropriate so that even if data were compromised, it would be unreadable to unauthorized parties.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> We restrict access to personal information to authorized employees and service providers who need that information to operate, develop, or improve our Services. Those who have access are bound by strict confidentiality obligations. All OC Dispensary staff are trained on the importance of privacy and security. Employees handling Protected Health Information receive additional HIPAA training and understand the legal obligations to protect PHI.</li>
  <li><strong>Secure Infrastructure:</strong> We store data on secure servers and cloud services that have strong security practices. Our systems are protected by firewalls and monitoring systems to guard against outside threats. We regularly update our software and systems to address security vulnerabilities as soon as they become known. Where possible, we keep personal and health data segregated or pseudonymized to add extra layers of protection.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Security:</strong> Any online payment transactions are processed through PCI-DSS compliant payment gateways which use industry-standard security. We do not store your full payment card information on our systems after the transaction is completed (except perhaps the last four digits for reference). This reduces the risk of exposure of your financial data.</li>
  <li><strong>Testing and Auditing:</strong> We periodically test our systems and processes for security weaknesses. This includes conducting security audits, vulnerability assessments, and intrusion detection. For PHI, we adhere to HIPAA Security Rule requirements and conduct risk assessments to ensure we maintain administrative, technical, and physical safeguards for health information.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we strive to protect your information with these measures, it’s important to note that no website, internet transmission, or computer system is completely secure or immune from every possible threat. We cannot guarantee absolute security of data. However, we continually update and improve our security practices to meet or exceed industry standards. In the unfortunate event of a data breach that affects your personal information or PHI, we will notify you and the appropriate authorities as required by law (for example, HIPAA regulations require us to notify affected patients and government regulators in the event of certain types of PHI breaches). We also encourage you to play a role in keeping your data secure: use strong passwords for your accounts, keep your login credentials private, and notify us immediately if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account or to our Services.</p>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We will retain your personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. How long we retain data can vary depending on the type of information and the reasons we have it:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Customer Account Information:</strong> If you have an account with us, we will keep your basic account details (like name, contact information, and login credentials) for as long as your account is active. If you choose to delete your account or it becomes inactive, we may retain certain information for a period of time in case you decide to reactivate, or for record-keeping purposes, but we will either delete it or anonymize it when we no longer have a legitimate need to retain it.</li>
  <li><strong>Transaction Records:</strong> We retain records of your purchases and transactions to comply with our legal obligations and for our internal business records. For example, state cannabis regulations and tax laws may require us to maintain purchase logs and related data for a certain number of years. We will keep those records for at least the minimum duration required by law, and longer if needed for business management or to resolve any potential disputes.</li>
  <li><strong>Medical and Health Information:</strong> If you are a medical cannabis patient, we may be required by law to retain your PHI (such as dispensing records or related medical documentation) for a specified period (often several years, depending on state healthcare record requirements). Even if you are no longer a customer, we may not immediately delete PHI if it is subject to these legal retention requirements. We store such information securely and limit access to it as required by HIPAA and state laws. After the required retention period passes, we will securely dispose of or de-identify the PHI.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing Data:</strong> Information used for marketing (such as email subscription lists or cookie data) is kept until you unsubscribe or request deletion, or after a period of inactivity. If you opt out of marketing communications, we will retain your contact info on a suppression list (to ensure we respect your opt-out) rather than delete it completely.</li>
  <li><strong>Backup and Archived Data:</strong> Please note that we may have backup systems or archived copies of data (e.g., in server backups) that are not immediately deleted when you delete your data from our live systems. If we restore data from a backup, we will make sure to honor any deletion requests in the restored data as well. Backup data is kept only for system recovery purposes and follows strict retention schedules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the retention period expires and we have no ongoing legitimate business need or legal obligation to keep your information, we will either delete it or anonymize it (so that it can no longer be associated with you) in a secure manner. If deletion is not immediately feasible (for example, if your data is stored in archives), we will isolate it and protect it until deletion is possible.</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>You have certain rights and choices regarding your personal information and how we handle it. We want you to be informed and empowered to make decisions about your data. These rights may vary based on your location and whether any specific privacy laws (like HIPAA for health information) apply to your information. Below is an overview of your rights and how to exercise them:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Access and Portability:</strong> You have the right to request access to the personal information we hold about you. This means you can ask us to confirm if we are processing your data and to provide you with a copy of that data, in a common format. For example, you can request a copy of your account information or purchase history. For any medical records or health information we have (PHI), you also have the right under HIPAA to access that information. We will provide you with your data, barring certain exceptions (if legally we cannot for specific reasons, we will explain why). In many cases, you can also access and review certain information directly by logging into your account on our app or website.</li>
  <li><strong>Correction (Rectification):</strong> We want to make sure your information is accurate and up-to-date. If you find that any personal information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request that we correct or update it. This could include updating your contact information, or, for health records, adding a missing piece of information. Some corrections you can do yourself by logging into your account (for example, you can change your profile details). For anything you cannot change yourself, contact us and we will make the correction where possible or let you know why we cannot (for instance, if the information is part of a record we are legally required to keep unchanged).</li>
  <li><strong>Deletion (Right to Be Forgotten):</strong> You can request that we delete your personal information. We will honor such requests to the extent we are able to do so and as required by applicable law. Please note there are some situations where we may not be able to immediately delete data: for example, if we are legally required to keep it (such as certain transaction records or PHI as noted in the Data Retention section) or if the data is needed to complete a transaction you requested. If you ask for deletion, we will remove what we can and let you know if anything must be retained and why. Deleting your data may involve closing your account. Once your data is deleted, your account may become inactive and you might have to create a new account to use our Services again.</li>
  <li><strong>Marketing Communications Opt-Out:</strong> If you have subscribed to our promotional emails or SMS messages, you have the right to unsubscribe at any time. You can opt out by clicking the “unsubscribe” link in any marketing email we send, or by replying “STOP” to a promotional text message. You can also manage your communication preferences in your account settings (if available) or by contacting us directly (see Contact Information below). Please note that even if you opt out of marketing messages, we may still send you essential communications about your transactions or account (for example, order confirmations, receipts, or important service updates) since those are not marketing but rather service-related.</li>
  <li><strong>Cookies and Advertising Choices:</strong> As described in the “Cookies and Tracking Technologies” section, you have choices to control cookies and online tracking. You can adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, and use industry opt-out tools for third-party advertising cookies. If our mobile app uses any analytics or crash reporting that you wish to opt out of, check your device settings for options to limit data sharing (for instance, you can usually disable sharing of app usage data with app developers). We will honor any such settings or opt-out signals to the extent feasible. Additionally, if you don’t want to see targeted ads from us on third-party platforms, you can use the opt-out methods provided by those platforms (for example, Google’s Ad Settings or Facebook’s ad preferences) to control ad personalization.</li>
  <li><strong>Do Not Sell or Share (for California Residents):</strong> While not explicitly requested in this policy, we note for transparency that OC Dispensary does not “sell” personal information for monetary value. If you are in a jurisdiction like California that grants you the right to opt out of the sale or sharing of personal information, know that we do not sell your data. We only share it with third parties as described in this policy for business purposes. If you have any questions or want to ensure your preferences, you can contact us.</li>
  <li><strong>HIPAA Privacy Rights (for Medical Cannabis Patients):</strong> If you provide us with PHI as a medical patient, you have additional rights under HIPAA regarding that health information:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Right to Access and Copies:</em> You can request an overview or copy of your health records and PHI that we maintain. For example, you can ask for a record of your purchases that are considered medical transactions or any other health information we have on file about you. We will provide this to you in a timely manner, usually within 30 days as required by HIPAA (and often sooner), and we may charge only a reasonable cost-based fee if applicable by law.</li>
      <li><em>Right to Request Amendment:</em> If you believe that any health information we have about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request an amendment to your record. We will review your request and if we agree, we will amend the information. If we deny the request (for instance, if we believe the record is accurate or we did not create the record), we will provide you a written explanation and you have the right to have your disagreement noted in the record.</li>
      <li><em>Right to an Accounting of Disclosures:</em> You can request a list (an “accounting”) of certain disclosures of your PHI that we have made. This typically would include disclosures for purposes other than treatment, payment, or health care operations (which are the routine uses), and those that were without your authorization. We will provide this accounting covering a period of up to the past six years, as required by HIPAA. (Note: disclosures made to you or with your consent, and certain other disclosures like those for national security, may not be included in the accounting.)</li>
      <li><em>Right to Request Restrictions:</em> You have the right to request that we restrict the way we use or disclose your PHI for treatment, payment, or health care operations. For example, you might ask us not to share a certain piece of information with a particular partner. While we will consider all reasonable requests, please understand that we are not always required to agree to a requested restriction if it would affect our ability to provide you services or comply with law. However, one exception under HIPAA: if you pay for a service or product out-of-pocket in full and request that we not inform your health insurer about that specific purchase (if applicable), we will honor that request, unless a law requires us to share that information.</li>
      <li><em>Confidential Communications:</em> You can request that we communicate with you about your PHI in a certain way or at a certain location. For example, you may ask that we contact you only at a specific email address or send mail to an alternate address. We will accommodate reasonable requests when possible to protect your privacy.</li>
      <li><em>Right to a Copy of HIPAA Notice:</em> You have the right to obtain a paper or electronic copy of our full HIPAA Notice of Privacy Practices at any time. That Notice provides more detailed information about our duties and your rights regarding PHI. You can request it from us (see Contact Information below) or find it on our website.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> Privacy is a serious matter for us, and we want to address any concerns you might have. If you believe your privacy rights have been violated or you have a complaint about how we handle your personal information or PHI, you have the right to file a complaint. You can contact us directly (see “Contact Information” below) to let us know of your concern, and we will work with you to resolve it. Additionally, if your complaint involves PHI and you feel we did not address it adequately, you have the right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office for Civil Rights, since they oversee HIPAA compliance. We will provide you with the contact information for HHS if you request it. Rest assured, we will not retaliate against you for any complaint you make in good faith.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exercising Your Rights:</strong> To exercise any of the rights above, please contact us using the information in the Contact section. For certain requests (like accessing or deleting information), we may need to verify your identity to ensure we’re providing access to the correct person and to safeguard against fraudulent requests. Verification might involve confirming personal details or asking you to submit the request through your logged-in account or in writing. We will respond to your request within the time frame applicable under relevant laws. If we need more time, we will let you know why and how much additional time is needed.</p>
<p>Please note that some rights may not apply in all jurisdictions. We will inform you if a particular right you are invoking is not available under the law applicable to your information. However, we will do our best to honor your requests about your data to the extent possible, even if not legally required, because we value transparency and user control.</p>

<h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>Our Services are intended only for adults who are 21 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect or solicit any personal information from anyone under the age of 21. Individuals under 21 should not use our mobile app or website or provide any information to us. If you are under 21, please do not attempt to register on our site or make purchases through our Services.</p>
<p>In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and general child privacy principles, we also do not knowingly collect information from children under 13 years old. Our site is not designed for children in this age group, and we do not target or market cannabis products to minors. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected personal information from someone under 21 (and especially under 13), we will take prompt steps to delete that information from our records. For example, if a minor somehow bypasses our age-gate and creates an account, once discovered, we will terminate the account and remove associated data.</p>
<p>If you are a parent or guardian and you believe your child (under 21) has provided information to us, please contact us immediately (see Contact Information below). We will work with you to investigate and delete any such information as required.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> In certain jurisdictions, such as in medical cannabis programs, minors may receive cannabis through a parent or guardian acting as a caregiver, but our Services are directed to the adult caregiver, not the minor. Any information provided in that context should be about the adult caregiver or the necessary medical documentation, and not directly from a minor. We ensure that any minor-related medical information (if provided) is treated with the highest confidentiality and in accordance with the law, but again, minors should not directly use our app or website.</p>

<h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update or modify this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, or for other operational reasons. When we make changes, we will post the updated Policy on our website and update the “Last Updated” date at the top of the Policy. If the changes are significant, we may also provide a more prominent notice, such as a banner on our website or an alert via email or within our app, to inform you of the update.</p>
<p>We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information. Any changes will become effective when the updated Privacy Policy is posted, unless stated otherwise. If you continue to use our Services after a Privacy Policy update, it signifies your acceptance of the revised terms (to the extent permitted by law). If we seek to use your personal information in a materially different way than we claimed at the time of collection, we will notify you and obtain consent as needed.</p>
